                <b>Abstract. </b>    <p>
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in text generation and comprehension, with recent advancements extending into multimodal LLMs that integrate visual and audio inputs. However, these models continue to struggle with fine-grained, cross-modal temporal understanding, particularly when correlating events across audio and video streams. <br>
                    We address these challenges with two key contributions: a new dataset and model, called <code>OCTAV</code> (<b>O</b>mni <b>C</b>ontext and <b>T</b>emporal <b>A</b>udio <b>V</b>ideo) and <code>OMCAT</code> respectively. <code>OCTAV</code> (<b>O</b>mni <b>C</b>ontext and <b>T</b>emporal <b>A</b>udio <b>V</b>ideo) is a novel dataset designed to capture event transitions across both modalities. Second, <code>OMCAT</code> (<b>O</b>mni <b>C</b>ontext <b>A</b>ware <b>T</b>ransformer) is a powerful model that leverages <code>RoTE</code> (Rotary Time Embeddings), an innovative extension of RoPE, to enhance temporal grounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks. <br>
                    Through a robust three-stage training pipelineâ€”feature alignment, instruction tuning, and <code>OCTAV</code>--specific training--<code>OMCAT</code> excels in cross-modal temporal understanding. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) tasks and the <code>OCTAV</code> benchmark, showcasing significant gains in temporal reasoning and cross-modal alignment, as validated through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies.
